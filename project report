Project Report: Password Strength Checker
1. Introduction
In today’s digital world, passwords are the most common method of authentication. Weak passwords are vulnerable to attacks such as brute force, dictionary attacks, and phishing. This project aims to develop a simple Python-based tool that evaluates the strength of a password based on multiple criteria and provides feedback to the user.

2. Objectives
To design a program that checks password strength.

To ensure the password meets basic security requirements (length, character diversity).

To provide real-time feedback to users for improving their passwords.

To classify passwords into Weak, Medium, or Strong categories.

3. Methodology
The project uses Python’s built-in string handling functions to analyze the password. The methodology includes:

Input Handling: User enters a password via the console.

Validation Checks:

Minimum length of 8 characters

Presence of lowercase letters

Presence of uppercase letters

Presence of digits

Presence of special characters (~!@#$%^&*()_-+={}[]|\;'<>,.?/)

Strength Calculation: Each satisfied condition increases the strength score.

Classification:

Score ≤ 2 → Weak

Score = 3 or 4 → Medium

Score = 5 → Strong

4. Implementation
The program is implemented in Python. Below is the core logic:

python
pswd = input("Enter your password:")
strength = 0

# Length check
if len(pswd) >= 8:
    strength += 1
else:
    print("Password atleast have 8 characters")

# Lowercase check
if any(ch.islower() for ch in pswd):
    strength += 1
else:
    print("Add minimum one lowercase letter.")

# Uppercase check
if any(ch.isupper() for ch in pswd):
    strength += 1
else:
    print("Add minimum one uppercase letter.")

# Digit check
if any(ch.isdigit() for ch in pswd):
    strength += 1
else:
    print("Add at least one number.")

# Special character check
special = "~!@#$%^&*()_-+={}[]|\\;'<>,.?/"
if any(ch in special for ch in pswd):
    strength += 1
else:
    print("Add one special character.")

# Final result
if strength <= 2:
    print("Password Strength is WEAK")
elif strength == 3 or strength == 4:
    print("Password Strength is MEDIUM")
else:
    print("Password Strength is STRONG")
5. Results
Example 1
Input: abc123

Output:

Code
Password atleast have 8 characters
Add minimum one uppercase letter.
Add one special character.
Password Strength is WEAK
Example 2
Input: SecurePass1

Output:

Code
Add one special character.
Password Strength is MEDIUM
Example 3
Input: StrongPass1!

Output:

Code
Password Strength is STRONG
6. Conclusion
The project successfully demonstrates a simple yet effective way to evaluate password strength. While it covers basic rules, future improvements could include:

Checking against common dictionary words.

Using entropy-based calculations for more accurate strength measurement.

Integrating with GUI or web applications for broader usability.
